# Chapter 1 Professionalism

## Discussions

What do you do for (software) professionalism?

I am doing my activities

- Mentoring (42Seoul, pesonal, Hanium ICT, ...)
- Academic conference: Read the software books and review together
- Online self-codeing group: During 2 hours study something at every SAT 10:30 AM

Learn and understanding Software engineering and craftsmanship, and then implementation to my works or products.
