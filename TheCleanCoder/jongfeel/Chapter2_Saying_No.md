# Chapter 2 Saying No

## Discussions

Did you have say "NO" when you working in progress scheduled project?

In my case, sometimes say "No". But I really understanding co-worker's status and reason. Good communication leads to success work scheduling. Additional benefit is scheduling under my control.

## Reviews

Two cases.

- Conversations Mike and Paula for project schedule, who is more professinoal? Paula becuase say "no".
- John Blanco blog. Say "yes" costs to be high risk.

Uncle bob tell us what is professional.
